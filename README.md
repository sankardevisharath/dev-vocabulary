# dev-vocabulary
Every time I listen to a technology podcast, read a technology article, or discuss something with seniors, I learn at least one new technical term. This technical term can be technology, methodology, software, tool, library, etc. You do not need to know in-depth about these terms, but just to understand the conversation. This repo is a collection of such terms.
